'''*Built-in Function Assignment Question*

1. Write a function called data_analyzer that processes a list of numeric values and returns a dictionary with the following information:

    -> The sum of all values (using the appropriate built-in function)
    -> The minimum and maximum values (using appropriate built-in functions)
    -> The average (mean) of all values (calculate this using built-in functions)
    -> The number of values that are above the average
    -> A sorted version of the original list (using the appropriate built-in function)

2. Write a function called transform_data that takes a list of numbers and performs these operations:

    -> Filter out all negative numbers (using filter())
    -> Square each remaining number (using map())
    -> Calculate the product of all resulting values (using functools.reduce()) '''
